         Log File Analyzer User Stories.

        Project Summary:
        Log File Analyzer is a tool that reads, processes, and analyzes log files from a web server, providing insights into server performance, errors, and user activities. 
        It uses asynchronous operations to handle file I/O while still processing other tasks.

        User Stories:
        User Story 1: Asynchronous Log Reading
        Description: As a user, I want to read log files asynchronously so the application remains responsive.
        Technologies Used:
        async/await: For asynchronous file reading.
        Asynchronous I/O operations: To read files without blocking the main thread.
        tryparse: To safely convert string log entries to numeric types.

        User Story 2: Multithreaded Processing
        Description: As a user, I want to analyze logs in parallel to speed up processing.
        Technologies Used:
        Multithreading: To distribute log analysis across multiple threads.
        Queue: Use a queue for FIFO processing of log entries.

        User Story 3: Data Structuring and Analysis
        Description: As a user, I want to structure and analyze log data efficiently.
        Technologies Used:
        List<T>: To hold log entries or processed data.
        Jagged arrays: For organizing data by different log aspects (e.g., timestamps, IP addresses).
        Tuple: To return multiple values from methods like log analysis results.
        GUID: To generate unique identifiers for each log entry for tracking purposes.
        switch statements: For categorizing log entries by type or severity.
        do-while loop: For iterating through logs until a condition is met or all logs are processed.
        dequeue: To remove processed logs from the queue.

        User Story 4: String and Numeric Operations
        Description: As a user, I want to manipulate strings and numbers within logs.
        Technologies Used:
        RegEx: To parse log entries and extract information like timestamps or IP addresses.
        Math.Abs: To compute absolute differences, like time intervals between logs.
        CultureInfo & InvariantCulture: For handling date/time or numeric formatting consistently across different systems.

        User Story 5: Performance and Memory Management
        Description: As a user, I want the application to be memory efficient and performant.
        Technologies Used:
        Garbage Collection: Understanding when objects are collected to manage memory.
        Boxing & Unboxing: When dealing with collections or when passing value types to methods expecting objects.

        User Story 6: Dynamic Code Generation
        Description: As a user, I want to generate dynamic filters or analysis methods based on log data.
        Technologies Used:
        CodeDOM: To dynamically compile and execute filters or analysis logic.
        Lambda Expressions: For defining quick, inline operations on log data.

        User Story 7: Error Handling and Null Checks
        Description: As a user, I want robust error handling and null checks to ensure application stability.
        Technologies Used:
        Null-coalescing operators: To provide default values when dealing with potentially null values in logs.

        Implementation Details:
        Inheritance: The log analyzer could inherit from a BaseAnalyzer class, which might define common methods or properties.
        Console Command: Interaction with the user would be through console commands for starting analysis, specifying files, etc.
